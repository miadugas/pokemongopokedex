# Pokemongo Pokedex

A small application that will fetch pokemon data from a PokemonGO API ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json ) and render them using Reactjs. Out of the available endpoints I displayed the name, num, type & weaknesses. Added an input with functionality to search by name to filter the search results, also added a filter to display by type and weakness.
